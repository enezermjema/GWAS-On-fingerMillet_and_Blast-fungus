# GWAS-On-fingerMillet_and_Blast-fungus

Finger millet is one among the small grain millets which is an important food and income source for most of the people in the rural and semi-arid areas in eastern Africa. Most of the farmers use unimproved varieties which are vulnerable to biotic and abiotic stresses. Finger millet blast disease, caused by the filamentous oomycete fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, accounts for up to 90% of yield losses experienced in combination with other abiotic stresses. Efforts to characterize the population diversity of this fungus in eastern Africa have been done recently. The development of blast-resistant finger millet varieties is widely accepted as the preferred approach towards blast management, compared to the alternative use of pesticide, which is expensive. For this to be achieved, knowledge of the genetic basis of resistant traits in finger millet is essential.
